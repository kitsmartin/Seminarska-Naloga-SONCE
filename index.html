          <h2 style="text-align:center">Early Life</h2>

        <p> Wijnand Otto Jan Nieuwenkamp was born on <strong>27 July 1874 in Amsterdam</strong>. Nieuwenkamp started drawing when he was a child and decided that he wanted to be an artist. His father disagreed with his decision and sent him to <strong>grammar school in Haarlem</strong>. But it wasn’t long before Nieuwenkamp failed and decided to continue his education in Amsterdam. He took some lessons at the <strong>Amsterdamse Kunstnijverheidsschool</strong> (Amsterdam School of Applied Arts) and he graduated in 1892. He started working in his father's office, but it wasn't a big success. In 1894 Nieuwenkamp studied at the <strong>National School of Crafts in Amsterdam</strong> but it wasn’t long before he left and decided to learn about the profession of art on his own. <p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Beginning of his activity</h2>
    <p> From that time onwards Nieuwenkamp became <strong>self-sufficient</strong>, creating illustrations for various magazines. He established his <strong>own studio in Haarlem</strong> where he met other famous Dutch artist who influenced his style. His works show influences of Jugendstil or Art Nouveau. <p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Trips to Bali</h2>
         <p> From 1898 onwards, numerous journeys took him to the islands of the East Indian archipelago, especially to Bali. He was cycling around and using his drawing tools to quickly capture all his impressions. It were those journeys to the Netherlands East Indies that had a particularly strong influence on his development as an artist. <p>
